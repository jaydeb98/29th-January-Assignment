    "1. Guido van Rossum developed the Python\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Python supports several programming such as:\n",
    "a. Procedural programming\n",
    "b. Object-oriented programming (OOP)\n",
    "c. Functional programming\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Yes, Python is case-sensitive when dealing with identifiers. \n",
    "It means that variables, functions, classes, and other identifiers in Python are differentiated by their case. \n",
    "For example, \"PWSKILLS\" and \"PWSkills\" would be treated as two separate identifiers in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. The correct extension for Python files is \".py\". \n",
    "\n",
    "5. Python code is typically interpreted. \n",
    "When you run a Python program, the source code is processed by the Python interpreter line by line, executing each line as it encounters it. \n",
    "This is known as the \"interpreted\" approach, where the interpreter directly executes the code without prior compilation.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. The main blocks of code used in Python are:\n",
    "\n",
    "Functions: It is defined by using the def keyword, and this functions allow you to group related code together and reuse it.\n",
    "Conditional Statements: Such as if, elif, and else.\n",
    "Loops: Such as for and while, used for repeating a block of code multiple times.\n",
    "Classes: Defined using the class keyword.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. The character used to give single-line comments in Python is the hash symbol (#).\n",
    "    \n",
    "8. To find the version of Python we can use \"sys.version\".\n",
    "    \n",
    "9. Python supports the creation of anonymous functions at runtime using a construct called \"lambda functions\" or \"lambda expressions.\"\n",
    "    \n",
    "10. In Python, \"pip\" stands for \"pip installs packages\" or \"Pip Installs Python.\" \n",
    "    \n",
    "11.  Some commonly used built-in functions in Python include:\n",
    "\n",
    "print(): Used to display output on the console.\n",
    "len(): Returns the length of an object (such as a string, list, or tuple).\n",
    "input(): Reads input from the user via the console.\n",
    "range(): Generates a sequence of numbers.\n",
    "type(): Returns the type of an object.\n",
    "int(), float(), str(): Convert values to integer, float, or string, respectively.\n",
    "max(), min(): Returns the maximum or minimum value from a sequence.\n",
    "sum(): Returns the sum of all elements in a sequence.\n",
    "sort(): Returns a sorted version of a sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "12. In Python, the maximum possible length of an identifier is not explicitly defined. \n",
    "    However, according to the Python style guide, the recommended maximum length for an identifier is 79 characters. \n",
    "    \n",
    "13. The Benefits of using Python are:\n",
    "\n",
    "a. Readability and simplicity\n",
    "b. Large standard library\n",
    "c. Portability\n",
    "d. Extensive third-party ecosystem\n",
    "e. Integration capabilities\n",
    "f. Rapid prototyping and development\n",
    "g. Active community and support\n",
    "    \n",
    "14. Memory management in Python is handled automatically through a combination of techniques, including garbage collection and reference counting. \n",
    "    Python uses a garbage collector to reclaim memory occupied by objects that are no longer in use. \n",
    "    Reference counting keeps track of the number of references to an object, and when the reference count reaches zero, the memory occupied by the object is freed. \n",
    "    \n",
    "15. To install Python on Windows and set path variables, you can follow these steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "i. Visit the official Python website (https://www.python.org) and navigate to the Downloads section.\n",
    "\n",
    "ii. Download the latest Python installer for Windows, based on your system architecture (32-bit or 64-bit).\n",
    "\n",
    "iii. Run the installer and select the option to \"Install Now.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "iv. On the next screen, make sure to check the box that says \"Add Python to PATH.\" This will automatically set the necessary environment variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "v. Proceed with the installation by clicking \"Install.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "vi. Once the installation is complete, open the command prompt or PowerShell and type python --version to verify that Python is installed correctly. You should see the version number displayed.\n",
    "\n",
    "vii. To confirm that the path variables are set correctly, you can type python in the command prompt and press Enter. The Python interactive shell should start without any errors.\n",
    "    \n",
    "16. Yes, indentation is required in Python. \n",
    "    Unlike many other programming languages that use braces or other explicit symbols for defining blocks of code, Python uses indentation to determine the grouping and hierarchy of statements. "
